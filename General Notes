char and integer are compatible
All characters are an integer value of 0 to 128 for the normal ascii character values as an unsigned integer


size_t represents an unsigned integral type recommended for variables representing an array's size or subscripts
size_t is defined in header <stddef.h>
size_t is converted with specificion %zu

char c one spot in memory - add 3 characters into that and it does out of bounds. 
getchar() returns 1 character. 
int s = 13; // type 13 things
int x;
while (s--) {
  x = getchar(x);
putchar(x);
}

getchar() gives back the ASCII code of the character that it returned. it returns 1 integer.
