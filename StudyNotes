Chapter 12 Part 1

Structures containing a member that's a pointer to the same structure type is referred to as a...
  self-referential


A self-referential structure contains a ... member that points to ....
  a pointer, a structure of the same type


A __________ pointer normally indicates the end of a data structure.
NULL



A __________ occurs when dynamically allocated memory is not returned when it's no longer needed.
memory leak



__________ memory allocation is the ability for a program to obtain more memory space at execution time and to release space no longer needed.
Dynamic



If no memory is available malloc returns a(n) __________ pointer.
NULL




Which of the following statements is true?
A structure's size is the sum of the sizes of its members. - false
A structure's size is not necessarily the sum of the sizes of its members. -> true



Which is correct?
Use the sizeof operator to determine the size of a structure.



Not returning dynamically allocated memory when it is no longer needed can cause a system to run out of memory prematurely. This is called a(n) __________.
memory leak



When memory allocated with malloc is no longer needed, return that memory to the system immediately with __________.
free




Which of these is not a common programming error?
Question 11 options:

select this answer if none of the other answers are valid.
Freeing memory (with free) that was not dynamically allocated.



__________ is not an advantage of linked lists when compared to arrays.
Direct access to any list element


Data Structures
Stacks insertions and deletions are made only at one end of a stack - its top.
Queues represent waiting lines, insertions are made only at the back, (referred to as the tail)
of a queue and deletions are made only from the front (also referred to as the head) of a queue.
Binary trees facilitate high-speed searching and sorting of data, efficient elimination of
duplicate data items, representing file system directories and compiling expressions into machine language.


Self-referential structure contains a pointer member that points to a structure of
the same structure type.



How many pointers are contained in a circular, doubly linked list with five nodes?
10
Total Pointers = Number of Nodes × Number of Pointers per Node
Total Pointers = 5 × 2 = 10

Select this answer if none of the other answers are valid.

Class 12 Part 2

Linked lists, linked list


__________ are important in compilers and operating systems - insertions and deletions are made only at one end of a __________ --its top.
Stacks, stack


__________ represent waiting lines; insertions are made at the back (also called the tail) and deletions are made from the front (also called the head) of a __________.

Binary Trees



Which of the following is a non-linear data structure?
binary tree



Which of the following statements about stacks is incorrect?
stacks are first in, first-out (FIFO) data structures. <-- this is incorrect because
stacks are last in first out - LIFO
Queues are first in first out - FIFO



The link member in the last node of a stack is typically set to __________ indicate the bottom of the stack.
NULL



Which of the following statements is false?
Function pop removes a node from the bottom of the stack.



Which is not a popular application of stacks?
maintaining waiting lines


A linked list has the functions insertAtFront, removeFromFront, insertAtBack, and removeFromBack, which perform operations on nodes exactly as their names describe. Which two functions would most
naturally model the operation of a queue?
insertAtBack and removeFromFront.



Queues are linear data structures with the property that queue nodes are inserted only at the tail of the queue and removed only from the head of the queue. For this reason, queues are referred to as __________ data structures.
first-in, first-out


Which of the following is not true of queues?
The entry at the front (or head) of the queue is the next to be removed.
Select this answer if none of the other answers are valid.
Queues are used to support print spooling.
Network packets wait in queues for service at routers. 
Queues are used to support high-speed sorting algorithms. <---


Select the incorrect statement. 
Binary trees (regardless of the order in which the values are inserted into the tree):
always have the same shape for a particular set of data. <--

Binary trees do not always have the same shape for a particular set of data. 
The shape of a binary tree depends on the order in which the values are inserted. 
For example, inserting values in sorted order would create a skewed (degenerate) tree, 
while inserting values randomly would result in a more balanced tree.



Suppose you have a list of names sorted in alphabetical order, already stored in one of the data types below. The easiest way to print the names in reverse alphabetical order would be to use a
stack
Using a stack would be the most straightforward way to print names in reverse alphabetical order. 
Since a stack follows the last-in, first-out (LIFO) principle, you can push the names onto the 
stack in their original order and then pop them off to print them in reverse order. 
a b c d e f g ....
then pop from the top, which is g.



Which statement about trees is false?
A tree is a non-linear, two-dimensional data structure.
Select this answer if none of the other answers are valid.
Binary tree nodes contain exactly two links.
Tree nodes contain two or more links.
Binary tree nodes contain two or fewer links. <--- 



Which statement is not true for binary trees.
A node with no children is called an orphan. <--- not true, nodes with no children are called leaf nodes
The left child in the root node is the first node in the left subtree.
The root node is the first node in the tree.
Select this answer if none of the other answers are valid.
The children of a node are called siblings.


Which of the following statements about binary search trees with no duplicate values is false?
Select this answer if none of the other answers are valid.
The shape of the tree that corresponds to a particular set of data can vary based on the order in which the values are inserted into the tree.
The values in any right subtree are less than the values in its parent node. <---
The values in any left subtree are less than the values in its parent node. 
It is possible that a binary tree could contain all its values along one straight path through the tree.



A node can only be inserted __________ in a binary search tree.
as the root node
as a parent node
select this answer if none of the other answers are valid

select this answer if none of the other answers are valid.
post-order traversal
in-order traversal <---

Which of the following statements about binary search trees is false?

When searching a tightly packed billion-element search tree, only about 30 elements (or fewer) are required to locate most elements.
In a tightly packed binary search tree, each level contains about half as many elements as the previous level. (The previous level is the level closer to the root node.) <---
