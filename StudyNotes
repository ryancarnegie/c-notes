Chapter 12 Part 1

Structures containing a member that's a pointer to the same structure type is referred to as a...
  self-referential


A self-referential structure contains a ... member that points to ....
  a pointer, a structure of the same type


A __________ pointer normally indicates the end of a data structure.
NULL



A __________ occurs when dynamically allocated memory is not returned when it's no longer needed.
memory leak



__________ memory allocation is the ability for a program to obtain more memory space at execution time and to release space no longer needed.
Dynamic



If no memory is available malloc returns a(n) __________ pointer.
NULL




Which of the following statements is true?
A structure's size is the sum of the sizes of its members. - false
A structure's size is not necessarily the sum of the sizes of its members. -> true



Which is correct?
Use the sizeof operator to determine the size of a structure.



Not returning dynamically allocated memory when it is no longer needed can cause a system to run out of memory prematurely. This is called a(n) __________.
memory leak



When memory allocated with malloc is no longer needed, return that memory to the system immediately with __________.
free




Which of these is not a common programming error?
Question 11 options:
Calling malloc in a statement without using sizeof. <-- correct
Referring to memory that has been freed.
Assuming that the size of a structure is simply the sum of the sizes of its members. <-- ? wrong
select this answer if none of the other answers are valid.
Freeing memory (with free) that was not dynamically allocated.



__________ is not an advantage of linked lists when compared to arrays.
Direct access to any list element


Data Structures
Stacks insertions and deletions are made only at one end of a stack - its top.
Queues represent waiting lines, insertions are made only at the back, (referred to as the tail)
of a queue and deletions are made only from the front (also referred to as the head) of a queue.
Binary trees facilitate high-speed searching and sorting of data, efficient elimination of
duplicate data items, representing file system directories and compiling expressions into machine language.


Self-referential structure contains a pointer member that points to a structure of
the same structure type.



How many pointers are contained in a circular, doubly linked list with five nodes?
10
Total Pointers = Number of Nodes × Number of Pointers per Node
Total Pointers = 5 × 2 = 10




A linked list is a __________ collection of self-referential structures, called nodes, connected by pointer links.
linear



Which statement is false?
Dynamic memory allocation can sometimes use memory more efficiently than using fixed-size data structures.
Select this answer if none of the other answers are valid.
Dynamic memory allocation incurs execution-time overhead.
Arrays are normally stored contiguously in memory.
Linked lists are normally stored contiguously in memory. <---




Passing a pointer to a pointer is called __________.
double indirection




Class 16
The ftell function returns:
number of bytes from beginning of file to the current location in file 


Which one of the following is NOT a symbolic constant used with fseek?
SEEK_END
SEEK_SET
SEEK_BEG <-- not real 
SEEK_CUR



What is/are the disadvantage(s) of using a sequential file?
Cannot modify a record without the risk of affecting other records
Cannot directly access an individual record
Both a) and b)



In the statement: fseek(cfPtr, 63, SEEK_SET);
The second parameter 63, instructs the program to move the file pointer 63 records from the beginning of the file.
	b) False


The function fread can read more than one record at a time
	a) True





Class 17

A pipe (|) causes:
the output of the first program to be redirected to the input of the second 



The atexit() function:
registers a function to be called upon the termination of the program



The goto statement is which of the following?
an unconditional branch
an instance of unstructured programming
used to change the program’s flow of control 
all of the above <-- correct answer



The realloc() function leaves the contents of the object being reallocated unchanged up to the size of the new object created.
	a) True



The malloc() function is preferred over calloc() because it clears the memory it allocates
	b) False



The following command: myprog > output.txt will redirect the output of myprog and append the output to output.txt.
	b) False


The literal value 4.3 is assumed to be a float
	False
the literal value 4.3 is assumed to be a double by default. 
If you want to specify it as a float, you can use the f or F suffix, like 4.3f.




The realloc function will always allocate the requested memory "in place"
	b) False
it may allocate the requested memory in place, but it can also move the block of memory to a new location.





Class 18

Function pointers can be:
assigned to another function pointer
passed as an argument
stored in arrays
all of the above <-



Function pointers contain:
base address of an array of arguments to the function
base address of the function code <-
address of the return value
none of the above



The compare function takes void pointer arguments because:
it allows the passing of any data type <-




Qsort can sort on multiple fields by:
sorting on secondary field if primary field is equal




Compare returns the following value when elements are equal:
0




The compare function is called only once when calling qsort:
	b) False



The compare function has a return type of void:
	b) False from gtp
answer key says true. 





Qsort can sort on multiple fields:
	a) True <- according to d2l, but gtp said false.
qsort in standard C can sort elements based on a single key only. <- from gtp



Class 19

The #undef preprocessor directive:
allows macros to be redefined with #define later in the program 



Which one of the following is not an error?
defining a function prototype without the extern keyword when the definition is in another file




extern:
is a keyword to indicate that a variable is defined in a different file 



Which of the following restricts the scope of a global variable to the file it is defined in?
static




what are capabilities of the preprocessor?
inclusion of other files in the file being compiled 
definition of symbolic constants
definition of macros



If the macro
 #define RECTANGLE_AREA( x, y ) ( ( x ) * ( y ) )
 has been defined.

Then the line
 rectArea = RECTANGLE_AREA( a + 4, b + 7 );
 will be expanded to:

rectArea = ( ( a + 4 ) * ( b + 7 ) );



The statement: #include <header.h> will check the current directory for the existence of the file header.h
	b) False
 you should use #include "header.h".



A C compiler compiles a .c file directly:
	b) False
A C compiler typically goes through several stages, including preprocessing, compiling, assembling, and linking. 



One of the goals of multi source file programs is to avoid recompling an entire program when small changes are made:
	True
One of the advantages of using multiple source files in a program is that it allows for incremental compilation
