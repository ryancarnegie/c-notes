The order in which statements are to be executed in a computer program is called program control or control flow.
The two key attributes of an algorithm are actions and order of actions.

Pseudocode helps a programmer think out a program, but does not typically include definitions.

Control structure encompasses sequence structure, selection structure, and repetition structure. 
Normally, statements in a program are executed one after another in the order they are written, called sequential execution.
C statements enable you to specify the next statement to be executed other than the next one in sequence, this is called transfer of control.

The if statement is called a single-selection statement. The if else is called a double selection statement.
An uninitialized variable contains the last value stored in the memory location reserved for that variable.

Counter-controlled repetition is often called definite repetition,
because the number of repetitions is known before the loop begins executing.

Indefinite repetition is controlled by a sentinel value.
In indefinite repetition, an input value should always be evaluated before being processed.

Which operation does not take place in the following example?
int x = 21;
double y = 6;
double z = 14;
y = x / z;
x = 5.5 * y;
1) promotion
2) implicit conversion
3) truncation
4) explicit conversion
